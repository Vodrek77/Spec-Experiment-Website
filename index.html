  <center><h3>First Look at Spectrometers and Reflectance of Visible Light</h3></center>

  <!-- Introductory text beneath the subheader of the website -->
  <center><p>
    For this experiment, we looked at how Spectroscopy can alow us to identify the color of an object based on data
    gained from reflected light of the object. In this case, we used handheld Spectrometers with built in colored lights
    to test the percent reflectivity of a colored folder, allowing us to identify the color of the folder without ever
    seeing it, all based off of this reflectivity data. This is because objects, such as the folders, reflect more light
    of their "color" seen by us as visible light. This was a pretty cool experiment, and the results will be below!
  </p></center>

  <!-- Text describing the base process and the "standard" calibration that we used -->
  <center><p>
    To start this experiment, we had to calibrate our instruments, in this case, the Spectrometers that we were using. 
    To do this, we had to take into acount the "Dark Voltage", or the value that the Spectrometer returns without any 
    of the lights being pressed and added to the mix. In our case, our Spectrometer showed a Dark Voltage of 82, which 
    is important, as it plays into the reflectivity value of the "Standard" and "Sample" values. The calibration is the 
    "Standard" value, and in this case, we calibrated the instrument on a white piece of paper to get the base or Standard 
    values for the instrument.
  </p></center>

  <!-- More Information -->
  <center><p>
    To figure out our standard reflectivity, we used the equation (Standard Result - 82)/Standard Result. Allowing us to 
    determine the base reflectivity on a white surface, which should, in theory, reflect equal values for each color. The 
    results are shown in the graph below.
  </p></center>

  <!-- More Information on experiment for "Sample" -->
  <center><p>
    As seen in the graph above the Standard values are what would be expected, a high reflectivity value for each color 
    across the board. Now that we have our Standard values, we can test and compare reflectivity on other surfaces, our Sample test. 
    For this, we used colored folders that we tested with each color and recorded the results to show their reflectivity among 
    different colors. The goal is that we will be able to identify the color of the folder from the graph alone, without ever seeing 
    the original object. Though the colors are listed on the graph below, see if you can determine from the spectrometry data why 
    the color is correct.

  <!-- Data Conclusion and observations -->
  <center><p>
    As you can see, we tested 2 folders, a red folder and a green folder. The red folder's spectrometry data showed spikes in the Red 
    and Deep Red wavelengths, as well as having a greater Infrared reflectivity in 2 cases over the paper, mainly because the red is 
    closer to that end of the spectrum. This information allows us to identify the color of the folder without knowing it, and purely 
    based off of the spectrometry data. The second folder, the green folder, however, is a little bit harder to determine. In this case, 
    we had a grouping in the Blue/Cyan/Green territory, which indicates that the folder may be one of these colors. In this case, the 
    green folder was fairly dark, and because of that, returns slightly higher wavelengths, leading to the grouping around the Blue/Cyan/
    Green territory over a large spike in the Green wavelength like the Red folder had.

  <!-- Real world applications of spectroscopy -->
  <center><p>
    Identifying folder colors isn't really doing much, but this experiment demonstrated concepts of how spectroscopy is used in the 
    professional field, and even space. For example, when trying to identify a new rock on the moon, the spectroscopy data gives us 
    an idea of the color, as well as other attributes such as luster, which can be determined with a greater reflectivity. This can 
    help us determine what a rock is, or find something similar to it on Earth, giving us a better idea of its appearance and possible 
    attributes. Though this was a simple experiment, it shows these concepts in full light and was really insightful to how important 
    the use of spectrometry is in our world and worlds beyond ours.

  <!-- Personal remark and conclusion -->
  <center><p>
    Personally, I had a lot of fun with this experiment, and I hope that throughout this website, you learned something about spectroscopy, 
    or at least had fun trying to identify the folder's colors. Though I don't plan to do too much spectroscopy in the future, this was a 
    fun and insightful experiment into concepts in that field.
