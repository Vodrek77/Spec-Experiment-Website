  <center><p>
    For this experiment, we looked at how Spectroscopy can alow us to identify the color of an object based on data
    gained from reflected light of the object. In this case, we used handheld Spectrometers with built in colored lights
    to test the percent reflectivity of a colored folder, allowing us to identify the color of the folder without ever
    seeing it, all based off of this reflectivity data. This is because objects, such as the folders, reflect more light
    of their "color" seen by us as visible light. This was a pretty cool experiment, and the results will be below!

  <!-- Text describing the base process and the "standard" calibration that we used -->
  <center><p>
    To start this experiment, we had to calibrate our instruments, in this case, the Spectrometers that we were using. 
    To do this, we had to take into acount the "Dark Voltage", or the value that the Spectrometer returns without any 
    of the lights being pressed and added to the mix. In our case, our Spectrometer showed a Dark Voltage of 82, which 
    is important, as it plays into the reflectivity value of the "Standard" and "Sample" values. The calibration is the 
    "Standard" value, and in this case, we calibrated the instrument on a white piece of paper to get the base or Standard 
    values for the instrument.

  <center><p>
    To figure out our standard reflectivity, we used the equation (Standard Result - 82)/Standard Result. Allowing us to 
    determine the base reflectivity on a white surface, which should, in theory, reflect equal values for each color. The 
    results are shwon in the graph below.
